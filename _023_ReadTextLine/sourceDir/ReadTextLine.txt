	The Peace of Wild Things by Wendall Berry

	When despair for the world grows in me
	and I wake in the night at the least sound
	in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,
	rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.

	I come into the peace of wild things
	who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief.
	I come into the presence of still water.

	And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. 
	For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.
