PEACE
 
Peace flows into me
As the tide to the pool by the shore;
It is mine forevermore,
It ebbs not back like the sea.
 
I am the pool of blue
That worships the vivid sky;
My hopes were heaven-high,
They are all fulfilled in you.
 
I am the pool of gold
When sunset burns and dies, —
You are my deepening skies,
Give me your stars to hold.
 
Sara Teasdale  1884 - 1933 American
